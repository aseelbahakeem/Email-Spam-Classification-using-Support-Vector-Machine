# Email Spam Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an email spam classification system that can classify emails as either spam or not spam using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and web integration to provide a user-friendly interface. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data preprocessing, model training, and integration.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building the SVM model.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework used to create the web application.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework used for responsive web design.
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for handling AJAX requests.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the web application's front end.
- **Google Colab**: Used for model training and experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv). It contains 5,172 rows of email data with 3,002 features representing the most common words in the emails. Each email is labeled as spam or not spam.
